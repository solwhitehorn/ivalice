Welcome in Ivalice, a sub-page of my main webpage. This site will host some comprehensive guides related to games with ressources all over the internet.

The aim is to collect, organize and summarize some guides and tips on old "retro" games. 

The layout is the same as a documentation site with a search bar making it easy to look for a specific info. 

At the moment, Vagrant Story and Unicorn Overlord are the two first games that will be implemented. Content will be added as I progress through the games.
